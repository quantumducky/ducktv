DateTime to remember:
- no constructors, instances created with static method of()
- Period stores year/month/day P2Y26M17D
- Period ofWeeks() converts to days (week * 7)
- Duration stores hours/minutes/seconds (with fraction). ofMinutes(90) -> 'PT1h30M'
- Period / Duration of...() methods are static, nesting does not work.
  Period.ofMonths(2).ofDays(3) -> 'P3D'
- Instant can be obtained from ZonedDateTime, not LocalDateTime because no time zone
- Instant allows to add units day and small (NO MONTHS/YEARS!! although it displays it)

Strings and Locales:
- if multiple threads are updating same object, use StringBuffer not StringBuilder
- Locale constructors takes JUST LANGUAGE OR LANG AND COUNTRY: new Locale("en") / Locale("en", "US")
- extend ListResourceBundle and implement Object[][] getContents() method
- getObject() to retrieve no string values from java class resource bundle
